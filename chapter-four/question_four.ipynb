    "#### Use a software which includes a statistics package, like Matlab, Mathematica or Numpy in Python, to generate three synthetic datasets, each containing 10,000 integers that follow a power-law distribution with γ = 2.2, γ = 2.5 and γ = 3. Use k_min = 1. Apply the techniques described in ADVANCED TOPICS 4.C to fit the three distributions."
