    "\n",
    "#### In the t-party, gender plays no role, hence each newcomer is allowed to invite only one other participant to a dance. However, attractiveness plays a role: More attractive participants are more likely to be invited to a dance by a new participant. The party evolves following these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every participant corresponds to a node i and is assigned a time-independent attractiveness coefficient η_i.\n",
    "- At each time step a new node joins the t-party.\n",
    "- This new node then invites one already partying node to a dance, establishing a new link with it.\n",
    "- The new node chooses its dance partner with probability proportional to the potential partner's attractiveness. If there are t nodes already in the party, the probability that node i receives a dance invitation is Π_i=η_i/(∑_jη_j)=η_i/t⟨η⟩ where 〈η〉 is the average attractiveness."
